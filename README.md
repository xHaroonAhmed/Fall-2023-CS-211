This repository is for Professor Jerry Waxman's CS111 class in Fall 2023: Introduction to Algorithms in C++. 
All assignments built up on top of one another. Most basic datastructures were implemented from structs, 
classes, and vectors. 

Algorithms such as backtracking serve in most if not all assignments.

Happy Coding!
